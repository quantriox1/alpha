AirCell V1 is a custom-designed smart battery module for hybrid VTOL drones like Project HADD, engineered to deliver high burst power during lift, efficient energy during cruise, and real-time telemetry for flight optimization. Built with graphene-enhanced Li-Po cells, a fire-retardant composite casing, and an embedded sensor mesh, it offers superior thermal management, crash protection, and swappability under 10 seconds. Integrated with a smart BMS and flight-linked data output, AirCell V1 transforms the battery from a passive power unit into a modular energy brainâ€”positioning Quantriox to lead in UAV battery IP, defense-grade licensing, and scalable energy innovation.
